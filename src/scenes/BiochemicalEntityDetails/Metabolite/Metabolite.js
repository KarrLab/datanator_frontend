During bacterial growth, a very large proportion of the peptidoglycan polymer is degraded and reused in a process termed cell wall recycling. For example, the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli recovers about half of its cell wall within one generation.\nThe anhydromuropeptides are imported by the ampG-encoded muropeptide:H+ symporter.

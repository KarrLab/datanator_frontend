              <p>
                To help researchers find relevant data in the face of sparse
                measurements, one of the goals of <i>Datanator</i> is to help
                users find potentially relevant measurements of similar
                molecular biology (e.g., similar metabolites, RNA, proteins,
                reactions) in similar organisms (e.g., neighboring taxa) and
                environmental conditions (e.g., similar temperature, pH). For
                mRNA and proteins, this is achieved by displaying measurements
                of the mRNA/protein of interest, as well as measurements of
                orthologous mRNAs/proteins.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Datanator</i> uses OrthoDB&apos;s ortholog groups because
                they have wide taxonomic coverage, they have been generated via
                an unbiased, systematic approach, they are available in a
                machine-readable format, and they are available under an
                open-source license.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Datanator</i> uses orthology rather than gene names to
                identify similar mRNAs/proteins because gene names are not
                consistent across organisms (similar genes can have different
                names, and genes with similar names can have dissimilar
                sequences). Similarly, <i>Datanator</i> uses orthology rather
                than UniProt ids because each UniProt id only refers to a single
                gene in a single organism.

            <div className="faq-a">
              <p>The taxon input is used for two purposes in the data pages:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Sorting:</b> The taxon input is used to sort the
                  potentially relevant measurements by their taxonomic
                  similarity to the taxon of interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Filtering:</b> The taxon input is used to provide users a
                  slider for filtering the potentially relevant measurements by
                  their taxonomic similarity to the taxon of interest.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Note: due to the computational cost of calculating taxonomic
                similarity, the taxon input is not used to filter or rank search
                results. Going forward, we hope to use the taxon input to
                provide more relevant search results.

              The search results don&apos;t appear to be limited to the taxon

              Why does the search form ask for a taxon? Where is the taxon input
              used?
            </div>
            <div className="faq-a">
              <p>
                The search form asks for a taxon because, as described above,
                the data pages uses the taxon input to sort and filter
                potentially relevant measurements by their similarity to the
                taxon of interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                In designing <i>Datanator</i>, we felt that the simplest and
                most intuitive way to help users find data relevant to specific
                organisms is to begin by asking users both about (a) the
                molecules or reactions they want to find data about and (b) the
                taxon (organism) they would like data about. From the start,
                this design intentionally encourages users to think about
                finding data relevant to specific taxa. In particular, we felt
                this design was simpler than providing a form on each data page
                which asks users to enter their taxon of interest and uses this
                information to sort and filter measurements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Due to the complexity of calculating taxonomic similar,
                unfortunately, the search results do not yet filter or rank
                search results by their taxonomic similarity. The taxon input is
                only used to sort and filter measurements in the data pages.
              </p>

              <p>
                <i>Datanator</i> also aspires to help users find data from
                relevant environmental conditions. Ideally, this would be
                implemented symetrically by incorporating an input for the
                target environmental condition in the search form, and using
                this information to filter and rank the search results, and sort
                and filter the potentially relevant measurements in the data
                pages. We have chosen to implement filtering and sorting of
                environmental conditions differently from filtering and sorting
                taxa (genotypes) for several related reasons: environments
                require multi-dimensional descriptions (e.g., temperature, pH,
                gas pressures, media) which makes capturing the target
                environment and computing environmental similarity more complex,
                there is no commonly accepted way of systematically describing
                environments (e.g., no ontology of media), and <i>Datanator</i>{" "}
                does not consistently represent the environmental condition of
                each measurement because the sources that we have used to
                assemble <i>Datanator</i> provide different metadata (i.e. some
                sources record temperatures while others do not). We aspire to
                improve this going forward. In our opinion, this requires a
                community effort to annotate environmental conditions more
                consistently which, in turn, requires the development of data
                models and ontologies for describing environmental conditions.

                default, <i>Datanator</i> displays measurements of metabolites
                that have Tanimoto coefficients of 0.65 or higher. The

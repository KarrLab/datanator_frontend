            <div className="faq-a">
              To help researchers find relevant data in the face of sparse
              measurements, one of the goals of <i>Datanator</i> is to help
              users find potentially relevant measurements of similar molecular
              biology (e.g., similar metabolites, RNA, proteins, reactions) in
              similar organisms (e.g., neighboring taxa) and environmental
              conditions (e.g., similar temperature, pH). For mRNA and proteins,
              this is achieved by displaying measurements of the mRNA/protein of
              interest, as well as measurements of orthologous mRNAs/proteins.{" "}
              <i>Datanator</i> uses KEGG&apos;s ortholog groups because they
              have wide taxonomic coverage and are available in a
              machine-readable format.
              <i>Datanator</i> uses orthology rather than gene names to identify
              similar mRNAs/proteins because gene names are not consistent
              across organisms (similar genes can have different names, and
              genes with similar names can have dissimilar sequences).
              Similarly, <i>Datanator</i> uses orthology rather than UniProt ids
              because each UniProt id only refers to a single gene in a single
              organism.

                  <i>Datanator</i> can help investigators find genomic and
                  biochemical data to identify the initial conditions and rate
                  parameters of continuous and stochastic dynamical models. In
                  turn, this can help investigators construct more comprehensive
                  and more accurate models.

                <li>
                  <i>Datanator</i> can help investigators improve
                  constraint-based models of metabolism by helping investigators
                  find enzyme abundances and reaction velocities to constrain
                  the predicted fluxes of chemical transformation and transport
                  reactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Datanator</i> can help investigators modify models to
                  capture other organisms, tissues, and cell types by helping
                  investigators find data to re-calibrate model parameters. In
                  turn, this can help investigators compare organisms, tissues,
                  and cell types.

                  <i>Datanator</i> can also help investigators conduct

## Overview
A central goal of synthetic biology is to rationally design organisms. Similarly, a central goal of precision medicine is to tailor therapy to each patient based on their unique genome. Many engineering fields use computer-aided design (CAD) tools driven by mechanistic models to efficiently design complex systems such as planes. Analogously, more comprehensive and more predictive models of biological systems, such as [whole-cell models](https://www.wholecell.org), are needed to help bioengineers and physicians design biomachines and medical therapy.

One of the biggest bottlenecks to achieving such models is collecting and aggregating the large amount of data needed for model construction and verification. Due to advances in genomics and increased emphasis on data sharing, there is now extensive data about a wide range of biochemical entities and processes such as data about metabolite concentrations, RNA and protein abundances, and reaction rates. However, it remains difficult to utilize this information for modeling because the data scattered across numerous databases and publications; the data is described using different formats, identifiers, and units; and there are inadequate tools for finding relevant data for modeling a specific biological system in a specific environment.

The *Datanator* toolkit seeks to address these problems for biochemical modeling by providing investigators an integrated database of molecular data and tools for discovering relevant data for modeling projects and other meta analyses. Please see the [About](https://datanator.info/about) page for more information about the goals and features of *Datanator*.

The *Datanator* toolkit is composed of the following packages:
- [*Datanator*](https://github.com/KarrLab/datanator): Tools for aggregating and integrating diverse data from diverse sources into a single dataset and searching these datasets
- [*Datanator-data*](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/karrlab/packages/karrlab/datanator): An integrated dataset of data for modeling cellular biochemistry
- *Datanator-db*: MongoDB server for *Datanator-data*
- *Datanator-fulltext-db*: ElasticSearch server for *Datanator-data*
- [*Datanator-query-python*](https://github.com/KarrLab/datanator_query_python): Tools for querying *Datanator-db* and *Datanator-fulltext-db*
- [*Datanator-rest-api*](https://github.com/KarrLab/datanator_rest_api): REST interface for *Datanator-query-python*
- *Datanator-frontend*: This package, a web-based graphical user interface to *Datanator-db*.

This package provides a web-based graphical user interface to *Datanator-db*. A public, hosted version of the package is freely available at [https://datanator.info](https://datanator.info). The package provides investigators tools for browsing and searching *Datanator-db* to find data about biochemical entities of interest (e.g., metabolites, proteins, reactions). This includes tools for finding experimental observations from chemically and genetically similar entities (according to structural and sequence similarity) in phylogenetically similar organism (according to the NCBI Taxonomy tree) under similar enviromental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH). The package is implemented using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Development and deployment workflow
1. Create a Git new branch
2. Commit code to the new branch
3. Push the branch to GitHub
4. GitHub will automatically trigger [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/KarrLab/datanator_frontend) to run the unit test, integration tests, and other static analyses
5. Use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/KarrLab/datanator_frontend) to review the coverage of the tests
6. As needed, add additional tests and fix any failing tests
7. Once the new code passes the tests and has high coverage, create a [pull request](https://github.com/KarrLab/datanator_frontend/compare) to merge the new branch into the master branch
7. One of the main developers will review the pull request and request changes as necessary
9. Once any necessary changes have been made, one of the main developers will approve the pull request
10. GitHub will automatically trigger [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/KarrLab/datanator_frontend) to run the unit test, integration tests, and other static analyses for the master branch
11. Once the CircleCI build succeeds, https://datanator.info will automatically be updated to the latest revision of the master branch
